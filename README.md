# Bellabeat marketing case study
This project is a marketing case study to apply R language to a real world scenario.

## Business Task
To analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices and apply these insights to Bellabeat a product. Using this information, make high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.

## Dataset Used
For this project I used [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](http://https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker data from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore usersâ€™ habits.
